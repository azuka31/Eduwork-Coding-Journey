# Day 7 - Data Relation in Pandas

Guys, I do apologize that I can't attend the class today. But, I have prepared for you about data relation.
Please find the attachment about to table transaction.csv and customers.csv to solve these challenges

Question
1. How would you merge the `table_customers` and `table_transaction` tables to include all customer details along with their transaction details?
2. How can you filter the merged data to show only customers who have made a transaction?
3. Write a pandas command to calculate the total amount spent by each customer.
4. How can you find the customer who has spent the most based on the `Total` column in the `table_transaction`?
5. How would you join the two tables to include transactions for only those customers who are in a specific country, such as 'USA'?
6. Write a command to count the number of transactions made by each customer.
7. How can you list all customers along with the number of transactions and their total spending?
8. How can you update the `SupportRepId` in the `table_customers` based on certain conditions found in the `table_transaction`?
9. Write a command to create a DataFrame that lists all customers who have not made any transactions.
10. How can you extract and display the top 5 cities with the highest total transaction amounts?
